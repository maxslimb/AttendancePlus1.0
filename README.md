# Attendance Plus
This project is about how to take attendance using 
Wifi / Hotspot.
This project is a WiFi and Wifi Hostpot based attendance system for colleges. The gist of the project is to enable teachers to mark students present, without having to waste time in roll calls.

The app has two modes: One for the teacher and the other for the students. The Teacher shares a unique code with students which is the Wfif Hotspot Key.

The Students Then enter the given key/password and connects to the Wifi netwrok hosted by the teacher

Every time the teacher takes attendence, his/her phone creates a wifi hotspot using localonlyhotspot method which each student's device connects to. Once connected, the device broadcasts it's details, and on a succcessful confirmation, disconnects.

This project has been updated with modern UI Design, and now it also stores the attendance of the students.
